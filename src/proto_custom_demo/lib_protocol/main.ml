(*
Enforced signatures:

begin_application: Context.t -> block_header -> validation_state
    is used when validating a block received from the network.

begin_partial_application: Context.t -> block_header -> validation_state
    is used when the shell receives a block more than one level ahead of the current head (this happens, for instance, when synchronizing a node). This function should run quickly, as its main role is to reject invalid blocks from the chain as early as possible. 

begin_construction: Context.t -> ?protocol_data: block_header_data -> validation_state
     is used by the shell when instructed to build a block and for validating operations as they are gossiped on the network. This two cases are distinguished by the optional protocol_data argument: when only validating operations the argument is missing, as there is no block header. In both of these cases, the operations are not (yet) part of a block which is why the function does not expect a shell block header.
    
apply_operation: validation_state -> operation -> validation_state
     is called after begin_application or begin_construction, and before finalize_block, for each operation in the block or in the mempool, respectively. Its role is to validate the operation and to update the (intermediary) state accordingly.
    
finalize_block: validation_state -> validation_result
    represents the last step in a block validation sequence. It produces the context that will be used as input for the validation of the blockâ€™s successor candidates.
