Overview of the functions to be implemented:

begin_application: Context.t -> block_header -> validation_state
    is used when validating a block received from the network.

begin_partial_application: Context.t -> block_header -> validation_state
    is used when the shell receives a block more than one level ahead of the current head (this happens, for instance, when synchronizing a node). This function should run quickly, as its main role is to reject invalid blocks from the chain as early as possible. 

begin_construction: Context.t -> ?protocol_data: block_header_data -> validation_state
     is used by the shell when instructed to build a block and for validating operations as they are gossiped on the network. This two cases are distinguished by the optional protocol_data argument: when only validating operations the argument is missing, as there is no block header. In both of these cases, the operations are not (yet) part of a block which is why the function does not expect a shell block header.
    
apply_operation: validation_state -> operation -> validation_state
     is called after begin_application or begin_construction, and before finalize_block, for each operation in the block or in the mempool, respectively. Its role is to validate the operation and to update the (intermediary) state accordingly.
    
finalize_block: validation_state -> validation_result
    represents the last step in a block validation sequence. It produces the context that will be used as input for the validation of the blockâ€™s successor candidates.

let begin_application ~chain_id:_ ~predecessor_context ~predecessor_timestamp ~predecessor_fitness:_ (block_header: block_header) =
    (*Code to be executed upon receiving a block from the network 
    This is the starting process of "apply"/concat the block to the node's copy of the blockchain.
    Check the block header's info and more here before the shell proceeds to apply_operation
     *)


let begin_partial_application ~chain_id:_ ~ancestor_context ~predecessor_timestamp ~predecessor_fitness:_ (block_header: block_header) =

    (*Same as begin_application but mostly used when syncing with other nodes when the last block doesn't match the expected block by the node's own blockchain*)


let begin_construction ~chain_id:_ ~predecessor_context:ctxt ~predecessor_timestamp ~predecessor_level ~predecessor_fitness ~predecessor ~timestamp ?(protocol_data : block_header_data option) () =

    (* This will return the needed information so the baker can construct a block
    This name is somewhat misleading, as the protocol won't build a block by itself, instead, it requires some external trigger (the baker) for it to do so

     *)


let apply_operation ({ctxt; op_count; mode} as data) (operation: operation)  =
    (*
    Code to be executed for every operation included in the block
    It should return the context with the operations applied (remember, the context is immutable)
    For example. if it's a simple money transfer from A to B, it should return a context with the balances of each affected account updated

     *)



let finalize_block {mode; ctxt; op_count} (shell_header: Block_header.shell_header option) : (Updater.validation_result * block_header_metadata, error trace) result Lwt.t=
    (*Code to be executed after a block get's finalize, either finalizing  the construction, partial aplication of full aplication of a block
    It updates the current context and pushes that context (and more info) back up to the shell

     *)




let init chain_id ctxt block_header =

    (*Code to be executed before the protocol gets activated 

    This includes potential:
        - preparing the first block of the protocol 
        - storage "conversion" or transfers
        - Other relevant stuff
